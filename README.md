# Drug Classification using Machine Learning

## Overview
#### This project predicts the type of drug a patient should take based on their medical attributes using machine learning models. Multiple classification models are trained and evaluated to determine the most accurate method.

## Dataset

#### The dataset used is drug200.csv, which contains the following features:

* Age: Patient's age

* Sex: Male (M) or Female (F)

* BP: Blood pressure levels (LOW, NORMAL, HIGH)

* Cholesterol: Cholesterol levels (NORMAL, HIGH)

* Na_to_K: Sodium-to-Potassium ratio in blood

* Drug: Target variable (Type of drug prescribed)
